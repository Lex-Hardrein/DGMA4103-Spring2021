        <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
        <p>When there is no more room in hell, the damned will wander the earth</p>

        <h3>Chilling Vacancy</h3>
        <p>These images were taken from a time period of uncertainty, where fear rules all, paranoia slithers down the halls of every mind, and the truth of a living venom spit from the mouths of one’s fellow human being justifies even the most childish of anxieties. Knowing so much and still so little, our only course of action is to flee this invisible monster and pray to any god that will listen for a swift deliverance from this, our long national nightmare. Millions of lives have been relegated to distressed damsels pulled from some lofty storybook into a wide-awake nightmare – waiting on a gallant knight which may just be a spark of delirium we generated to keep us warm in a harsh winter.</p>
        <p>No one turns off the sun when you close your eyes. The world we all fled from stands still where it was left, now just an echoed insult of our inability to adapt in time. So much like a bad dream does the icy landscape harken back to what it once was – ringing with laughter and tears and kissed by a million and one footsteps – but now perverted into a zombified shell of its intended self, still as death and yet incencently clawing and gnawing away at those banal memories with the fiendish fervor of a cornered hellhound.</p>
        <p>The world around us stands alive still not for our sake, but because to die would take too much effort.</p>
        <h3>Kept like a Tomb</h3>
        <p>The general public's heightened fear of disease has led to an accentuated veneration of cleanliness. Even the aforementioned void is cleansed on a regular basis – adding a dreamlike and uncanny sense of having been recently lived in to the already undead looking ruins of the before times. Modern life in general fetishized a sleek and sterile aesthetic, though regular human interaction usually dulls the glow of such a style. Without the stains of past inhabitance, the upkeep of such fixtures invokes a tomblike sense of inevitability and morose – acting as an accidental memento mori to any unfortunate enough to wander into this our new asphodel.</p>
